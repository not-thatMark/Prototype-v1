The application is about converting some auslan sign language gestures into text messages.
Here is the list of the gestures available that you can freely make up your own lines and conversation.

In the future, I hope to develop this one to be a fully function dictionary for people who having trouble with hearing.
Moreover I wish I could but I could not make it smaller, I will try to implement this into a rasberry pi soon. At the moment it still run on Window.
